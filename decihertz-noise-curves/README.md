# Hisotrical noise curves

These sensitivity curves were used in the [Decihertz white paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.11375). 
These curves are characteristic strains, so the linear spectral density multiplied by sqrt(f). 
The files have been kept in their original format, which unfortunately means that they are not uniformly consistent.

- ALIA: `alia_char_Mueller.txt` (format: frequency - characteristic strain)
- DO-Optimal: `decigo2Mueller2.txt` (format:  frequency - characteristic strain)
- DO_Conservative: `decigoMueller.txt` (format:  frequency - characteristic strain)
- DECIGO: `decigo_characteristic_formatcpp.txt` (format: dummy variable - frequency - characteristic strain)
- Atomic clock: `AtomClockGW_v2.txt` (format:  frequency - characteristic strain)

DO-Conservative is probably the best starting point for any studies of sensitivity.
